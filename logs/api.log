TensorFlow and JAX classes are deprecated and will be removed in Transformers v5. We recommend migrating to PyTorch classes or pinning your version of Transformers.
All model checkpoint layers were used when initializing TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification.

All the layers of TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification were initialized from the model checkpoint at models/phishing_distilbert_multilingual_optimized.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification for predictions without further training.
